# week-01-assignment

This is a splash page for my week one assignment in the bootcamp.

## Overall Requirements

- use this weeks' HTML and CSS flexbox skills to recreate a similar looking webpage to the SpaceX one
  - HTML and CSS structure and layout
  - background images and sizing options for visual design
  - box model and positioning
  - flexbox basics
- review and incorporate the user stories
- if time allows, incorporate the optional extra user stories

## Specific Requirements

- Each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags, and must include a <header>, <nav>, and <footer>
- Implement CSS absolute positioning to overlay text on an image or another element
- Utilise CSS Flexbox to create a flexible and responsive layout, particularly in the <nav> element
- Ensure all image elements (<img>) are correctly implemented with accurate src file paths

## User stories

1. As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
2. As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
3. As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
4. As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.
